Debian uses *deb packages to deploy and upgrade software. The packages are stored in repositories and each repository contains the so called "Contents index". The format of that file is well described here: https://wiki.debian.org/RepositoryFormat#A.22Contents.22_indices

The task is to develop a Python command line tool that takes the architecture (amd64, arm64, mips etc.) as an argument and downloads the compressed Contents file associated with it from a Debian mirror. The program should parse the file and output the statistics of the top 10 packages that have the most files associated with them. An example output could be:

./package_statistics.py amd64

1. <package name 1> <number of files>

2. <package name 2> <number of files>

......

10. <package name 10> <number of files>

You can use the following Debian mirror http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/.
